== Introduction

=== why ?

Go is a compiled language, therefore it is much faster compared to other programming languages. What makes golang faster is that there is no runtime when executing a golang app. 
Golang doesnâ€™t support Object Oriented Programming so it is more straightforward, but if designed properly can work just as well.
Golang supports concurrency which could be useful for many cases, unlike javascript or PHP which are single threaded programming languages. 
And finally golang has excellent dependency management which works like a composer, but in a much more efficient way and is already built in in golang.

=== Hello World

[source,go]

----

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
----

== Syntax 

=== Variables

Variables in Go can be defined in two ways

[source,go]

----
var s string // var declaration

s := "" // short variable declaration

----

In Go, there is zero-value mechanism for value. This mechanism ensures every variables in Go have default values (no variables are left uninitalized).

Each of variable declared (var & short declaration) consists of:

- name
- type
- initialization value

For supported data types in Go, you can see in here:

=== Functions

A Function is used to wrap a sequence of statements as a unit. Function can be called everywhere (as long as they are defined with public access modifier). The importance of function:

- breaks a big job into smaller pieces
- hide implementation details from user point of view
- code reusability

In Go, function is declared like this

[source,go]
----
func name(parameter-list) (result-list) { body
    // body
}

----

Function has

- name
- parameters
- return types

There are several models of functions in Go

. By number of values returned
.. single value
.. multiple values

. By Parameters
.. variable
... by value
... by reference 
.. variadic

Please look at this example for all models of functions

- By return value

[source,go]
----

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	result := add(1, 2)
	fmt.Println(result)

	p, err := check("123")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(p)
}

// single return value
func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

type Person struct {
	ID   string
	Name string
}

func (p *Person) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("ID: %s\nName: %s", p.ID, p.Name)
}

// multiple values returned
func check(id string) (*Person, error) {
	return &Person{
		ID:   "123",
		Name: "Testt",
	}, nil
}
----

- By parameters

[source,go]
----

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	result := add(1, 2)
	fmt.Println(result)

	p := &Person{}
	defaultValue(p)
	fmt.Println(p)

	res := sum(1, 2, 3)
	fmt.Println(res)

}

// by value
func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

// by reference. notes data type such as: channel, map, slice
// are passed by reference
type Person struct {
	ID   string
	Name string
}

func (p *Person) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("ID: %s\nName: %s", p.ID, p.Name)
}

func defaultValue(p *Person) {
	p.ID = "test-123"
	p.Name = "Test"
}

// variadic

func sum(nums ...int) int {
	var acc int
	for _, num := range nums {
		acc += num
	}
	return acc
}
----

There are some additional variations of functions:

- Anonymous function

[source,go]

----
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	squared := func(n int) int {
		return n * n
	}
	fmt.Println(squared(2))
}
----

- Recursion

[source,go]

----
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println(positiveExp(2, 4))
}

func positiveExp(b, n int) int {
	if n == 0 {
		return 1
	}
	return b * positiveExp(b, n-1)
}

== Package

Go programs are structured in package. Package is a way to embrace DRY principle. A package is nothing more than a folder consists of multiple go source files. You can think package as the workspace.

image::golang_package_illustration.png[]

To start with package, the syntax is like this

[source,go]

----
package <your package name>
----

Inside a package, we can decide whether a particular struct or functions can be exported or it stays private.

[source,go]

----
package example

// Goes exported
// you can call it example.Public
type Public struct {

}

// Stays private inside the package
type private struct {

}
----

All internal libraries in Go use package. For example, package fmt. We can use this package to print out some stuffs to the stdout for example.

[source,go]

----
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}
----

If you notice, everytime you run a go program, the execution is placed inside main go with package main and function main.This is a special because it is used to indicate a go source is meant to be executable.
